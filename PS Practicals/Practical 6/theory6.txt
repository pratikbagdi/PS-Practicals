Aim :-
Multiple regression model 
Apply multiple regressions, if data have a continuous independent variable. Apply on above dataset. 

Theory :-
Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that helps us understand the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. It is an extension of simple linear regression, which only considers one independent variable.
Independent variables: These are the variables that are believed to influence the dependent variable. 
For e.g., Average area income, Average area house age, Average area number of rooms, Average area number of bedrooms, Area population
Dependent variable: This is the variable that we are trying to predict or explain. 
For e.g., price of a house
Linear relationship: The core assumption of multiple linear regression is that there exists a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This means that the changes in the dependent variable can be modelled as a straight line in relation to the changes in the independent variables.
Steps involved in building a multiple linear regression model:
1.	Data collection: Collect data that includes the independent variables and the dependent variable.
2.	Data preparation: Clean and pre-process the data to ensure its suitability for the analysis.
3.	Model fitting: Train the model using a training dataset, which helps the model learn the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
4.	Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate testing dataset to assess its generalizability and effectiveness in predicting the dependent variable.
5.	Interpretation: Analyze the model coefficients and intercept to understand the direction and strength of the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
