Aim :-
Classification Model
a. Install relevant package for classification.
b. Choose classifier for classification problem.
c. Evaluate the performance of classifier.

Theory :-
Classification Models -
•	Classification is a supervised learning task where the model learns from labelled data. This data consists of features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable).
•	The model’s objective is to learn the mapping between features and the target variable.
•	During prediction, the model takes unseen data with only features and predicts the corresponding category for the target variable.

Random Forest Classifier –
•	Random Forest belongs to a family of algorithms called ensemble methods. It combines multiple decision trees, where each tree makes a prediction and the final prediction is the majority vote of all trees.
•	This approach helps reduce variance and improve the model’s generalizability.

Installation and Imports – 
•	Scikit-learn is a popular python library for machine learning tasks, including classification. The code checks if it is installed and installs if it needed.
•	pandas is used for data manipulation.
•	train_test split helps split the data into training and testing sets. 
•	RandomForestClassifier is the chosen classifier from scikit-learn.
•	Accuracy_score and classification report are metrics used to evaluate the model’s performance.

Input :-
climate_change_data.csv – The dataset consists of 10000 observations on 9 variables they are data, location, country, temperature, CO2 emissions, Sea level rise, precipitation, humidity, Windspeed.
