Aim :-
Implement k-means algorithm to classify the iris dataset.

Theory :-
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids.
Algorithm Steps:
1.	Initialization: Randomly select K data points from the dataset as initial cluster centroids.
2.	Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
3.	Update Centroids: Calculate the mean of all data points in each cluster and update the centroids.
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until convergence, i.e., until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Application of K-means to Iris Dataset:
1.	Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset containing feature vectors representing the characteristics of iris flowers.
2.	Preprocessing: No significant preprocessing is required for K-means, as it operates on numerical feature vectors.
3.	K-means Clustering: Apply the K-means algorithm to cluster the iris data points into K clusters.
4.	Evaluation: Assess the quality of clustering using metrics like silhouette score or visually inspecting cluster separation.
5.	Visualization: Visualize the clusters and centroids to interpret the results and gain insights into the data distribution.
