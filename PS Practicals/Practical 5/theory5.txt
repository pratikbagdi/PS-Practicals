Aim :-
Regression Model 
Import a data from web storage. Name the dataset and now do Logistic Regression to find out relation between variables that are affecting the admission of a student in a institute based on his or her GRE score, GPA obtained and rank of the student. Also check the model is fit or not. Require (foreign), require (MASS).

Theory :-
Logistic regression is a powerful statistical technique widely used in machine learning for binary classification tasks. It aims to model the relationship between a set of independent variables (e.g., GRE score, GPA, rank) and a binary dependent variable (e.g., admission status) by estimating the probability of one class (in this case, admission) occurring given specific values of the independent variables.
•	Binary Classification: Logistic regression is suitable for predicting outcomes with two possible classes (e.g., admitted/not admitted), unlike linear regression, which handles continuous numerical targets.
•	Log-Odds Transformation: The core idea lies in transforming the linear combination of independent variables into log-odds of the target class using the sigmoid function (S-shaped curve). This ensures predictions remain within the valid probability range (0 to 1).
•	Model Coefficients: The model estimates coefficients for each independent variable, reflecting their individual contributions to the log-odds. Positive coefficients indicate a positive association with admission, while negative coefficients suggest an inverse relationship.

Input :-
Admission.csv – The dataset consists of 400 observations (rows) on 4 variables (columns) they are admit, gre, gpa and rank.
